### Why the penny-farthing is my favorite

- the penny-farthing, known as a high wheel in many parts of the world, has a front wheel much larger than the rear one
- the penny-farthing name relates to the relative sizes of the wheels; the penny and farthing were coins used in Victorian Britain, where the cycles were popular
- penny-farthings were phased out as safer alternatives resembling modern cycles were introduced
